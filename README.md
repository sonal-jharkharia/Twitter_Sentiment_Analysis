# Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis
Sentiment analysis (also known as opinion mining) is one of the many applications of Natural Language Processing. It is a set of methods and techniques used for extracting subjective information from text or speech, such as opinions or attitudes. In simple terms, it involves classifying a piece of text as positive, negative or neutral. The Kaggle Twitter Sentiment Analysis challenge is aimed to predict sentiment of a tweet and classify it as ‘positive’, ‘negative’ or ‘neutral’. 


For every tweet in the test set, submission files should contain two columns: tweet_id and sentiment.

The file should contain a header and have the following format:

tweet_id,sentiment
264238274963451904,positive
