# Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis
Sentiment analysis (also known as opinion mining) is one of the many applications of Natural Language Processing. It is a set of methods and techniques used for extracting subjective information from text or speech, such as opinions or attitudes. In simple terms, it involves classifying a piece of text as positive, negative or neutral. The Kaggle Twitter Sentiment Analysis challenge is aimed to predict sentiment of a tweet and classify it as ‘positive’, ‘negative’ or ‘neutral’.
